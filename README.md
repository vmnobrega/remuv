# Remuv
Removes new line "/n" from text. 
Made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This project was created to address a specific need of a friend of mine at work. He was constantly copying text from various sources and needed to remove the newline characters in order to format the text in a specific way. He asked me if I could help him automate this process and I saw it as an opportunity to put my front-end skills to the test.

I started by researching different ways to remove newline characters from text using JavaScript. I experimented with regex patterns and string manipulation methods until I found a solution that worked well. I then implemented this logic into a simple front-end application, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The final product is a web page that allows users to input text and then removes the newline characters. The user can then copy the cleaned text and use it.
